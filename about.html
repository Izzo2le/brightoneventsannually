<h3 style='color:white; text-align:center; background-color: red;'>May - Fringe Festival</h3>
          <p>Brighton Fringe is an open-access arts festival. It's the biggest arts festival in England and one of the biggest fringe festivals.

<h3 style='color:white; text-align:center; background-color: red;'>June - Naked Bike Ride</h3>
          <p>On the UK's traffic-congested roads, cyclists strip off to highlight their vulnerability. Everybody is welcome to ride or just offer support, in continuing the urgent message that we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels, especially in single-occupant cars, for planet survival.

Nakedness is not a requirement. Anyone under the age of 16 needs to be a confident cyclist, clothed and in the care of a responsible adult.</p>
